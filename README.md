## üöÄ How to Replicate This Project
Follow these steps carefully to set up and run this project on your own.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.

A GitHub account.

A Google account.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, get the project files on your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up the Google Sheet Database
Go to sheets.google.com and create a new, blank spreadsheet.

Rename the spreadsheet to something you'll remember (e.g., MyExpensesDB).

In the first row, create the following headers exactly:

Cell A1: Date

Cell B1: Category

Cell C1: Amount

Cell D1: Comments

Rename the tab at the bottom from "Sheet1" to Expenses.

Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud Service Account
This creates a secure "robot user" for your app to access the Google Sheet.

Enable APIs: Go to the Google Cloud Console, create a new project if prompted, and enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API.

### Create Service Account:

Go to the Service Accounts page.

Click "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT".

Give it a name (e.g., streamlit-bot) and click "CREATE AND CONTINUE".

Assign the role "Basic" -> "Editor". Click "CONTINUE", then "DONE".

Generate JSON Key:

In the list of service accounts, find the one you just created. Click the three dots under "Actions" -> "Manage keys".

Click "ADD KEY" -> "Create new key".

Choose JSON and click "CREATE". A .json file will be downloaded. Keep this file secure.

Share the Google Sheet:

Open the downloaded .json file with a text editor.

Copy the "client_email" value (e.g., streamlit-bot@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com).

Go to your Google Sheet, click "Share", paste the email, and give it Editor permissions.

Step 5: Set Up Local Secrets (for local testing)
In your project folder, create a new directory named .streamlit.

Inside the .streamlit folder, create a new file named secrets.toml.

Open secrets.toml and paste the following structure. Copy the contents of your downloaded .json file into the corresponding fields and update the sheet_name.

 .streamlit/secrets.toml

[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"

project_id = "your-project-id-from-json-file"

private_key_id = "your-private-key-id-from-json-file"

private_key = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"""

client_email = "your-client-email-from-json-file"

client_id = "your-client-id-from-json-file"

auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"

token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"

auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"

client_x509_cert_url = "your-client-x509-cert-url-from-json-file"

Add the name of your Google Sheet here

sheet_name = "MyExpensesDB"

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Locally
Once all the setup is complete, you can run the app on your local machine with this command:

Push your completed project to your GitHub repository.

Go to share.streamlit.io and sign up.

Click "New app" and select your repository.

Go to the "Advanced settings..." section and add your secrets, copying the content from your local secrets.toml file.
